					<h1><strong>Hi there, I'm Kyle</strong>!</h1>
					<p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Specialization in Mechanical Design and a
						Minor in Business Management at UCI. I have a deep passion for any and all things design oriented, ranging anywhere from simple hobby 3d print 
						all the way to the human-oriented robots that I work on at UCI's Biorobotics lab.  
						 Please check out some of the projects that have
					occupied my time in these past years.</p>

                <section id="one">
                    <h1>Bo-Bot</h1>
                    <p>With its body made of various recycled objects, this is the first iteration of Bo-Bot, a robot which stemmed from my wish to lighten the workload during rushes
                        at the boba store I worked at.</p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                            <img src="images/bobotfull.png"
                            style="object-fit:contain;
                            width:500px;
                            height:500px;
                            "/>
                    </div>  
                    <p>In the early planning phases, I knew that I wanted Bo-Bot to not only roam the store, but explicitly approach customers. The method of approaching customers
                        is one that gave me some trouble, but it was seeing the Termovision from the movie Terminator, particularly the way the Terminators use thermal vision to find targets,
                         that inspired me to use thermal 
                        sensors. By detecting an array of tiles that within an average range
                    of human body temperatures, Bo-Bot knew to lock on to that area as there was likely a human there. Here is a video of Bo-Bot in action!</p>
